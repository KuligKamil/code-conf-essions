# How Browser Works

## 1. Browser Engine

The browser engine is the core of the browser. It is responsible for parsing the HTML and CSS, rendering the content, and executing JavaScript. The browser engine consists of two main components:

1. **Rendering Engine**: The rendering engine is responsible for parsing the HTML and CSS, creating the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSSOM (CSS Object Model), and rendering the content on the screen.

2. **JavaScript Engine**: The JavaScript engine is responsible for executing the JavaScript code. Each browser has its own JavaScript engine, such as V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, and JavaScriptCore in Safari.

## 2. Browser Components

In addition to the browser engine, there are several other components that make up a modern web browser:

1. **Networking**: The networking component handles network requests, such as fetching HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources from the server.

2. **UI Backend**: The UI backend is responsible for drawing the browser's user interface, such as the address bar, tabs, buttons, and menus.

3. **UI Frontend**: The UI frontend is responsible for handling user interactions, such as clicking on links, typing in text boxes, and submitting forms.

4. **Data Persistence**: The data persistence component is responsible for storing data, such as cookies, local storage, and cache.

5. **Browser Engine Communication**: The browser engine communicates with the other components through various interfaces, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) and the Browser Object Model (BOM).

## 3. Browser Rendering Process

The browser rendering process consists of several steps:


1. **Parsing**: The browser engine parses the HTML and CSS to create the DOM and CSSOM.

2. **Layout**: The browser engine calculates the layout of the elements on the page, such as their size, position, and style.

3. **Painting**: The browser engine paints the content on the screen, using the layout information to determine how to render the elements.
