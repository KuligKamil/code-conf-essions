# When a variable name conflicts with a Python keyword, it’s recommended to add a trailing underscore to the variable name, following PEP 8’s recommendation.

# For example, instead of using class as a variable name, you should do something like the following:

# class_ = "Business"
# This allows you to avoid the SyntaxError that occurs when trying to use reserved keywords as variable names.
