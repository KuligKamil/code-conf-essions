<!-- 

Source-available refers to software whose source code is made publicly accessible, but it is not necessarily free or open-source in the traditional sense (as defined by the Open Source Initiative). While you can view and sometimes modify the code, the licensing terms often impose restrictions on how the software can be used, distributed, or modified.
