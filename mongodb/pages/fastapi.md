# Integration with **FastAPI**
**FastAPI: Modern, Fast Web Framework for building APIs**

* Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
* Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features.
* Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
* Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
