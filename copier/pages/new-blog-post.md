 <!-- 
 I am using Jekyll for my blog.

 I am not the best writer 
 but I am trying to improve my writing skills.

 Learn in public.  But new year new me. 
 
 With blog I can fight with my imposter syndrome. 
 
 To compare what I learn before and what I know now.


  I am using Github Actions to deploy my blog post.
